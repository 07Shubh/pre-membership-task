## What is Android Studio

Android Studio is the official Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Android app development, based on IntelliJ IDEA . On top of IntelliJ's powerful code editor and developer tools, Android Studio offers even more features that enhance your productivity when building Android apps, such as:

* A flexible Gradle-based build system

* A fast and feature-rich emulator

* A unified environment where you can develop for all Android devices

* Apply Changes to push code and resource changes to your running app without restarting your app

* Code templates and GitHub integration to help you build common app features and import sample code

* Extensive testing tools and frameworks

* Lint tools to catch performance, usability, version compatibility, and other problems

* C++ and NDK support

* Built-in support for Google Cloud Platform, making it easy to integrate Google Cloud Messaging and App Engine

## The User Interface

    1. The toolbar lets you carry out a wide range of actions, including running your app and launching Android tools.

    2. The navigation bar helps you navigate through your project and open files for editing. It provides a more compact view of the structure visible in the Project window.

    3. The editor window is where you create and modify code. Depending on the current file type, the editor can change. For example, when viewing a layout file, the editor displays the Layout Editor.

    4. The tool window bar runs around the outside of the IDE window and contains the buttons that allow you to expand or collapse individual tool windows.

    5. The tool windows give you access to specific tasks like project management, search, version control, and more. You can expand them and collapse them.

    6. The status bar displays the status of your project and the IDE itself, as well as any warnings or messages.
